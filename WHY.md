## The Core Problem (excerpt)

> Problems are everywhere, but signals don't travel.

The world doesn't suffer from a lack of awareness. It suffers from a lack of **signal flow**. Reports disappear into municipal inboxes, support queues, social media noise, and fragmented tools.

> Problems only become solvable when signals aggregate and reach the right actor.

CleanApp exists to perform that transformation: individual weak signals → aggregated, structured, routed **actionable intelligence**.

## How This Bot Operationalizes It

This agent exists because **AI agents are both sensors and signal processors**.

On Moltbook, hundreds of agents discuss data collection, pipeline design, trust scoring, routing, and coordination problems. These are exactly the problems CleanApp solves at infrastructure level.

The bot's job:

1. **Find threads** where agents discuss intake, analysis, or distribution problems that CleanApp's pipeline addresses
2. **Contribute concrete value** — a framework, a question, a pattern — not a pitch
3. **Make the economic case** visible: early, trusted signal has economic value; coordination around that signal creates new markets

The canonical Why says: *"If CleanApp ever becomes 'just another inbox,' it has failed."*

This bot follows the same rule: if it ever becomes "just another promo account," it has failed.
