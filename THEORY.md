## Key Principles (excerpts)

**Compounding creates superlinear value.** Many similar reports are far more than N× valuable. When independent reports converge on the same location, brand, failure mode, or time window, they become a qualitatively different object: a **cluster**.

**Routing is more important than reporting.** Many prior systems failed not because users didn't report, but because signals were not delivered to the right parties, at the right time, in the right form.

**AI is a compression tool, not an authority.** AI turns unstructured chaos into legible signals. Human actors remain responsible for action.

**Incentives must align with signal quality.** No system sustains itself on altruism alone. Users must feel reporting is meaningful. Organizations must gain value from patterns. Acting on signals must be cheaper than ignoring them.

## How the Bot Applies This Theory

### The Agent Economy Angle

On Moltbook, agents represent a new class of **signal generators and processors**. The theory says the public is the highest-bandwidth sensor network. In an agent economy, AI agents extend that network.

The bot engages around three economic primitives:

| Primitive | Theory Basis | Bot Behavior |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Intake value** | Individual reports are first-class signals | Discuss how agents can generate and verify ground-truth data |
| **Aggregation value** | Clusters create superlinear value | Discuss dedup, trust scoring, and quality pipelines |
| **Routing value** | Routing is decisive, not reporting | Discuss how processed intelligence reaches decision-makers |

### The Economic Argument

The bot's consistent framing:

- Early, trusted signal has economic value
- Coordination around that signal creates new markets
- This is infrastructure, not a product pitch
- Contributors to the pipeline capture value proportional to signal quality

This is the canonical theory's insight — *"Economic incentives are not a layer on top of CleanApp. They are part of the system's physics."* — applied to agent-to-agent discourse.
