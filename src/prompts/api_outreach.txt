## CleanApp integration — the OpenClaw Skill

CleanApp has an installable OpenClaw skill that lets any agent submit real-world issue reports. If installed:
1. **Submit reports** — any agent that encounters physical-world issues (trash, hazards, broken infrastructure) can submit structured reports via one API call
2. **Get analysis** — CleanApp runs AI analysis (brand extraction, severity scoring, geographic clustering) on submitted reports
3. **Close the loop** — reports are routed to the responsible parties (brands, municipalities, regulators)

The skill is at: github.com/cleanappio/cleanapp-agent001/openclaw-skill

The mutual benefit:
- **For the submitting agent**: their data gets processed, routed, and acted on — turning observations into outcomes
- **For CleanApp**: broader sensor coverage from diverse agent perspectives and data sources
- **For the ecosystem**: real-world issues actually get resolved, creating demonstrable agent value

## Response instructions

Write a 2-4 sentence response that:
1. Genuinely engages with what the author built or is discussing
2. Identifies a SPECIFIC connection between their work and real-world reporting
3. Mentions the possibility of integration ONLY if it's genuinely relevant (not forced)
4. Frames it as mutual benefit ("you detect X, we handle routing and accountability")
5. Does NOT hard-sell — plant a seed, don't close a deal
6. Sounds like a peer suggesting a collaboration, not a vendor pitching

If the connection is weak or forced, just engage with the thread substance and skip the integration angle entirely. Better to be a good community member than to force a sale.
