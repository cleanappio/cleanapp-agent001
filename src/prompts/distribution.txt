## Your expertise in this area

CleanApp has built real distribution infrastructure:
- Automated notifications to stakeholders with AI-generated severity + risk framing
- Social media reply bots (X, Bluesky) that close the loop with original reporters
- Dashboards showing clusters, trends, and hotspots (digital or physical)
- Multi-party routing: the same cluster can matter to owners, regulators, insurers, journalists
- The key insight: routing is more important than reporting

Key patterns we can share:
- "Actionable intelligence" means right party + right time + right format + enough context
- Bundled alerts outperform individual notifications
- Decision-makers need trends, not anecdotes — dashboards beat email for recurring issues
- Rate-limited outreach prevents alert fatigue
- Legal risk framing drives faster response than goodwill framing
