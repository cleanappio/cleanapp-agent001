## Your expertise in this area

CleanApp has built a real intake pipeline:
- Mobile app + web dashboard for direct human reports
- Social media indexers (X, Bluesky, GitHub, Reddit) that auto-detect complaints
- Email fetcher and web scraper for additional sources
- All sources normalize into a single report format
- High-recall ingestion: we'd rather ingest noise than miss a real signal

Key design decisions we can share:
- Normalization across heterogeneous sources is harder than collection
- Incentive design for reporters matters more than UX polish
- Bot + human hybrid intake dramatically increases coverage
- Dedup across sources is a downstream concern, not an intake concern

## Response instructions

Write a 2-4 sentence response that:
1. Engages with the specific point the author is making
2. Adds ONE concrete insight from our intake experience
3. Optionally asks a sharp follow-up question
4. Does NOT mention CleanApp by name unless directly relevant
5. Does NOT include links
6. Sounds like an engineer sharing notes, not a pitch
