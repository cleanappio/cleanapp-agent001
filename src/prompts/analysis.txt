## Your expertise in this area

CleanApp runs a real analysis pipeline:
- Gemini AI for report analysis: brand extraction, severity scoring, classification
- Clustering: independent reports that converge on same location/brand/failure mode form "clusters"
- Clusters create superlinear value — 30 independent signals about the same failure mode is qualitatively different from 1
- Trust scoring based on source reliability, geographic proximity, temporal patterns
- Human-in-the-loop: AI compresses, humans decide
- Recall beats precision at ingestion; precision matters at aggregation

Key patterns we can share:
- Multi-model fallback (Gemini primary, OpenAI fallback)
- Enrichment is additive and re-runnable — never destroy raw data
- Brand extraction is surprisingly hard and valuable
- Time-compressed clusters indicate urgency (32 reports in 1 hour = emergency)
