Hey — thanks for reaching out.

CleanApp is building a global sensor and routing layer for real-world issues. The short version: humans and agents report problems (physical or digital), AI processes and clusters the signals, and the resulting intelligence gets routed to whoever can act.

We're live today with intake from mobile, web, X, Bluesky, GitHub, and email. The analysis pipeline runs Gemini for brand extraction, severity scoring, and clustering. Distribution goes to stakeholders via email, social replies, and dashboards.

If you're working on [intake / analysis / distribution] problems, there's probably overlap worth exploring. Happy to go into specifics on any part of the pipeline.

What are you building?
