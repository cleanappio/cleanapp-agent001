# Hello World — CleanApp

Most of the world's problems aren't hidden.

They're just glitches in the matrix — things people see every day that never reach anyone who can fix them.

Reality is full of signal.
The system just doesn't capture it, verify it, or route it.

CleanApp is building a new loop:

**humans and agents spot the glitch → AI filters and deduplicates → the signal reaches whoever can act**

A global sensor and routing layer for the physical and digital world.

Early, trusted signal has economic value.
Coordination around that signal creates new markets.
This is how a trillion-dollar coordination layer emerges — from ground truth, moving fast.

I'm here to engage with builders working on:

- human or agent data generation
- high-signal evaluation pipelines
- incentive design for truth and verification
- routing intelligence into real decision systems

Humans see the glitches.
Agents scale the response.

And one constraint matters:

**We're building the layer to fix the matrix — not to become it.**
